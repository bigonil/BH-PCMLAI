# Predictive Maintenance Using Machine Telemetry Data

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a predictive maintenance system using machine telemetry data to forecast equipment failures. The goal is to enable proactive maintenance, thereby reducing downtime and maintenance costs in manufacturing environments.

## Project Objectives
- **Predict equipment failures**: Utilize machine telemetry data to predict when equipment will fail.
- **Proactive maintenance**: Schedule maintenance tasks ahead of potential failures to minimize downtime.
- **Cost reduction**: Reduce maintenance costs by preventing unnecessary maintenance and reducing the incidence of unexpected equipment breakdowns.

## Data Description
The dataset includes various forms of telemetry data:
- **Voltage**: Electrical measurements from the machinery.
- **Rotation**: Speed measurements from rotating parts of the machinery.
- **Pressure**: Pressure measurements within the machinery.
- **Vibration**: Vibration measurements indicating the physical state of the machinery.

Additionally, the dataset includes:
- **Error logs**: Records of error messages reported by the machinery.
- **Failure logs**: Records of when the machinery has failed.
- **Maintenance records**: Logs of when the machinery has been maintained.

## Methodology

### Data Preparation
- **Data Collection**: Gather telemetry data, error logs, maintenance logs, and failure logs.
- **Cleaning Data**: Address missing values, remove outliers, and synchronize timestamps across different types of data.

### Feature Engineering
- **Rolling Statistics**: Compute rolling means and standard deviations to capture trends and variability.
- **Lagged Features**: Include historical data points as features to provide context to the models.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Convert categorical data like error codes into a numerical format suitable for modeling.

### Model Development
- **Model Selection**: Evaluate various machine learning models including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, and Neural Networks.
- **Training and Validation**: Split the data into training and validation sets to ensure the models are robust and generalize well.

### Model Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate the models.
- **Visualization**: Generate ROC curves and Precision-Recall curves to visually assess model performance.

### Implementation
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Deploy the model to monitor machinery in real-time and predict failures.
- **Alert System**: Develop an alert system to notify technicians of predicted failures.

## Results
The predictive models developed were able to successfully identify potential failures with high accuracy. The Random Forest model performed exceptionally well, with a high AUC indicating its effectiveness in distinguishing between failure and non-failure states.

## Future Work
- **Explore Advanced Models**: Investigate more complex models like Deep Learning architectures including CNNs and Transformers.
- **Enhance Feature Engineering**: Develop more sophisticated feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy.
- **Expand Data Collection**: Integrate more data sources to enrich the models' training datasets.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using machine telemetry data for predictive maintenance. By implementing this system, manufacturing facilities can expect a significant reduction in unplanned downtime and maintenance costs.
